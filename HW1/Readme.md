# HW1: Imitation Learning
The goal of this assignment is to experiment with imitation learning, including direct behavior cloning
and the DAgger algorithm. In lieu of a human demonstrator, demonstrations will be provided via an expert
policy that we have trained for you. Your goals will be to set up behavior cloning and DAgger, and compare
their performance on a few different continuous control tasks from the OpenAI Gym benchmark suite. Turn
in your report and code as described in Section 5
