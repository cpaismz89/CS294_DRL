# HW5c: Advanced Topics - Meta-Learning
Deep reinforcement learning algorithms usually require a large number of trials. So far with the tools we have learned in this course, learning a new task entails re-collecting this large dataset and training from scratch. Intuitively, knowledge gained in learning one task should help to learn new, related tasks more quickly. Humans and animals are able to learn new tasks in just a few trials. In this assignment, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages prior experience to figure out how to solve new tasks quickly. In recent literature, such methods are referred to as meta-reinforcement learning Mishra et al. [2018], Finn et al. [2017], Wang et al. [2016], Duan et al. [2016].
